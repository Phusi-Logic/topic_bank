# topic_bank
A simple program to store a bank of topics input by the user in a text file, and recall these in random order if the user requires.

The topic_bank.exe file can be downloaded and used as an executable file. One additional file is required, an emtpy .txt file must be created in whichever folder the topic_bank.exe file is saved in, and this file must be named "topic_bank.txt". This file will be used to store all the saved topics. The directory can be changed as long as these two files are always in the same directory.

To add topics:
Simply type the topic in the box below the "Enter new topic" label, and then either press enter on the keyboard, or click on the "Enter topic" button with the mouse. This topic will then be stored in a new line in the topic_bank.txt file.

To view topics at random
Simply click the "Pick random topic" button, and a randomly chosen topic will appear in the box below. The same topic entry will not appear twice, unless the "Reset random topics" button is pressed.
Any topics entered with "Enter new topic" in the current session can't be accessed by "Pick random topic" until the program has been restarted.
